# bioinformatics
For this project, we are doing some bioinformatics (specifically genetics). 

We wrote functions involved with turning a DNA sequence into an amino acid sequence (protein). 

"main.cpp": This file uses the function declarations in "bio.h" to convert a DNA sequence to an amino acid sequence. 

"bio.h": This is the header file for "bio.cpp" and it has declarations and explanations for the implementation file. 

"bio.cpp": do the main stuff.
